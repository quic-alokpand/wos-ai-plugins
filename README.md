# AI Plugins for Windows on Snapdragon: Enhancing Applications with On-Device AI

Welcome to our repository! Here, we provide a collection of AI plugins specifically designed for Windows on Snapdragon applications. These plugins are developed using the [Qualcomm AI Engine Direct SDK (QNN)](https://www.qualcomm.com/developer/software/qualcomm-ai-engine-direct-sdk).

## Key Features

Our AI plugins offer the following key features:

- **On-Device AI**: All AI models run entirely on the device, ensuring data privacy and reducing latency.
- **NPU Offloading**: The AI computations are offloaded to the Neural Processing Unit (NPU) to optimize performance and power efficiency.
